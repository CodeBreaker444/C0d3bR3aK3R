### Step-3: Making a hole on the side of the box.
After removing the motherboard from the box.Make a hole on the side of the box opposite to the Ethernet port side of the box.I used my soldering iron to make the hole as it is plastic it went right through it.

Opposite side if the Ethernet Port.
### Step-4: Soldering the RP-SMA Coaxial cable to Motherboard.
Before soldering you have to cut the circuit of AN2.It disconnects the ground from main line.I used the screwdriver to disconnect the line razer can be used too.Be careful while cutting donâ€™t damage the other components.

Solder the ground wire to opposite circuit of main wire.

After finishing up the hardwork its time to wrap up everything.First insert RP-SMA pin into the hole and thenuse the give screws and tighten up from outside so that the pin will sit in its place.Now insert the motherboard and then the cap.Thatâ€™s it you have successfully upgraded your MR3020 Antenna to a powerfull one.
