<p>Open-up your router from top by inserting screwdriver into edges of the top cap.Now slowly lift of the cap from all sides feel free to use squeezers if you have any.</p>

<p>There are no screws in TP-LINK MR3020.So, don’t search for them.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-making-a-hole-on-the-side-of-the-box">Step-3: Making a hole on the side of the box.</h3>
<p>After removing the motherboard from the box.Make a hole on the side of the box opposite to the Ethernet port side of the box.I used my soldering iron to make the hole as it is plastic it went right through it.</p>

<p>Opposite side if the Ethernet Port.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-soldering-the-rp-sma-coaxial-cable-to-motherboard">Step-4: Soldering the RP-SMA Coaxial cable to Motherboard.</h3>
<p>Before soldering you have to cut the circuit of AN2.It disconnects the ground from main line.I used the screwdriver to disconnect the line razer can be used too.Be careful while cutting don’t damage the other components.</p>

<p>Disconnect by cutting the lines.</p>

<p>Now solder the Coaxial cable main wire to circuit which is beside the AN2.Feel free to use flux.</p>

<p>Solder the main wire to right circuit of AN2
After soldering the main wire its time to solder the ground wire to opposite circuit.</p>

<p>Solder the ground wire to opposite circuit of main wire.</p>

<p>After finishing up the hardwork its time to wrap up everything.First insert RP-SMA pin into the hole and thenuse the give screws and tighten up from outside so that the pin will sit in its place.Now insert the motherboard and then the cap.That’s it you have successfully upgraded your MR3020 Antenna to a powerfull one.
